# MIPS_32_SINGLE_CYCLE

## INTRODUCTION :
-An instruction set architecture is an interface that defines the hardware operations which are available to software.
-In a basic single-cycle implementation all operations take the same amount of timeâ€”a single cycle.
-A multicycle implementation allows faster operations to take less time than slower ones, so overall performance can be increased.
-Finally, pipelining lets a processor overlap the execution of several instructions, potentially leading to big performance gains.
