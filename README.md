# MIPS_32_SINGLE_CYCLE

## INTRODUCTION :
- An instruction set architecture is an interface that defines the hardware operations which are available to software.

- In a basic single-cycle implementation all operations take the same amount of timeâ€”a single cycle.
- A multicycle implementation allows faster operations to take less time than slower ones, so overall performance can be increased.
- Finally, pipelining lets a processor overlap the execution of several instructions, potentially leading to big performance gains.

### In order to understand these figures it is necessary to understand four things.
- How the clock is used.
- How the ALU is used.
- Instruction activities for the different types of instructions.
- The roles of the control signals.
- Datapath and Controlpath.
